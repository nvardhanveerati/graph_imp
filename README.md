# graph_imp
This project involves algorithms on graphs represented using adjacency lists.

Here,
- A weighted graph is read and represented using adjacency lists
- A variation of Djikstra's algorithm is implemented
- Custom queries are answered on the new variant of Djikstra's algorithm implemented.

This is implemented in C++, with dynamic memory allocation `new()` and deallocation `delete`.
No external libraries were used except standard libraries for I/O and string functions.
